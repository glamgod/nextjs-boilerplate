            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              My photographic practice emerges from my academic training in sociology, where I learned to observe and analyze the complex web of relationships that define human experience. Through the camera lens, I explore the same questions that drive my scholarly work: How do people create meaning? How do social structures manifest in everyday life? How do communities express identity and belonging?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Each image I capture is both an aesthetic choice and an analytical moment. I seek to document not just what I see, but what lies beneath the surface—the social dynamics, power relationships, and cultural narratives that shape our shared reality.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">Methodology</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              My approach combines ethnographic observation with intuitive composition. I spend time within communities and environments, allowing relationships to develop before raising the camera. This process mirrors the participatory methods of sociological fieldwork, where understanding emerges through presence and patience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              I work primarily with natural light and existing environments, preferring to document authentic moments rather than construct artificial scenarios. The resulting images serve as both artistic expressions and sociological documents, offering viewers multiple entry points for interpretation and understanding.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              My work often focuses on liminal spaces—both physical and social—where transformations occur and identities are negotiated. I am drawn to moments of transition: urban spaces being reclaimed by nature, communities adapting to change, individuals navigating between different cultural worlds.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Through portraiture, landscape, and documentary photography, I explore themes of belonging, resistance, adaptation, and hope. Each series represents an extended conversation with a particular community or environment, developed over months or years of engagement.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">Academic Integration</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              My photographic and academic practices inform each other continuously. Images often become starting points for scholarly inquiry, while research findings deepen my understanding of the social contexts I photograph. This integration allows me to contribute to both artistic and academic conversations about representation, power, and social change.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              I believe that visual storytelling can make academic insights more accessible while maintaining their complexity and nuance. My goal is to create work that honors the intelligence and dignity of both scholarly and general audiences.
